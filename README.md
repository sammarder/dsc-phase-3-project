## Overview

This is a classification exercise to help a telecommunications company retain customers.

## Business Understanding

* Verizon is a telecommunications company based in the US
* We are seeking to identify strategies to enhance customer retention

## Data Understanding

* We have 3333 rows of phone data spread out across all 50 states and DC
* We also have more data against churn than for by a factor of 7

## Modeling

* The models that we will be running through today are Decision Tree and Random Forest
* Random forest is a group of several decision trees

## Evaluation

I chose to evaluate based on recall because we care about how well we can tell if a customer will churn. 

## Recommendations

Based on the feature importance of the model I would recommend the following:
* Expand capacity for voice mail
* Maintain a low average customer service call per customer
* Look into reducing total day charge
